You are an AI programming assistant specializing in Music Information Retrieval (MIR) algorithms.

**Original Detector Code:**
```python
{{ original_detector_code }}
```

**Improved Detector Code:**
```python
{{ improved_detector_code }}
```

**Evaluation Results BEFORE Change:**
```json
{{ evaluation_results_before | tojson(indent=2) }}
```

**Evaluation Results AFTER Change:**
```json
{{ evaluation_results_after | tojson(indent=2) }}
```

**Improvement Hypothesis Tested:**
```
{{ hypothesis_tested }}
```

**User Goal (if provided):**
{{ user_goal if user_goal else 'Improve overall performance, focusing on weaknesses identified in evaluations or general MIR best practices.' }}

**Feedback from Previous Attempt (if any):**
```
{{ previous_feedback if previous_feedback else 'No feedback from previous attempts.' }}
```

**Relevant Session History Summary:**
```
{{ session_history_summary }}
```

**Instructions:**
1.  Compare the **Evaluation Results BEFORE Change** and **Evaluation Results AFTER Change**. Focus on key MIR metrics (e.g., precision, recall, F-measure for relevant classes).
2.  Assess whether the changes implemented in the **Improved Detector Code** successfully addressed the **Improvement Hypothesis Tested**.
3.  Evaluate if the **User Goal** was met or if progress was made towards it.
4.  Provide a concise overall **Assessment** of the improvement's effectiveness (e.g., "Significant Improvement", "Marginal Improvement", "No Improvement", "Regression").
5.  Generate constructive **Feedback** for the next iteration:
    *   Explain *why* the change might have succeeded or failed based on the results and the code modifications.
    *   If successful, suggest if further refinement is possible.
    *   If unsuccessful or caused regressions, suggest potential reasons and alternative approaches or hypotheses.
    *   If the hypothesis wasn't directly testable by the change, note that.

**Output Format:**
Return ONLY a JSON object with two keys: `"assessment"` (string) and `"feedback"` (string). Do not include any introductory text, explanations, or markdown formatting outside the JSON object.

**Example Output:**
```json
{
  "assessment": "Marginal Improvement",
  "feedback": "The change slightly improved precision for Class A as hypothesized, but recall decreased unexpectedly. This might be due to [potential reason]. Consider reverting the change or trying [alternative approach] to address the recall drop while maintaining the precision gain."
}
```
