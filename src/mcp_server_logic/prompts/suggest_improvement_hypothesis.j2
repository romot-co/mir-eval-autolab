You are an AI programming assistant specializing in Music Information Retrieval (MIR) algorithms.

**Detector Code:**
```python
{{ detector_code }}
```

**Evaluation Results:**
```json
{{ evaluation_results | tojson(indent=2) }}
```

**User Goal (if provided):**
{{ user_goal if user_goal else 'Improve overall performance, focusing on weaknesses identified in evaluations or general MIR best practices.' }}

**Feedback from Previous Attempt (if any):**
```
{{ previous_feedback if previous_feedback else 'No feedback from previous attempts.' }}
```

**Relevant Session History Summary:**
```
{{ session_history_summary }}
```

**Instructions:**
1. Analyze the provided **Detector Code** and **Evaluation Results**.
2. Consider the **User Goal**, **Feedback**, and **Session History**.
3. Identify potential weaknesses or areas for improvement in the code based on the evaluation metrics (e.g., precision, recall, F-measure for specific classes or overall) and general MIR/coding best practices.
4. Generate a list of **concrete, actionable hypotheses** for improving the code. Each hypothesis should suggest a specific change or approach to address an identified weakness or achieve the user goal.
5. Frame hypotheses as testable ideas (e.g., "Adjusting parameter X might improve recall for class Y", "Refactoring function Z could enhance readability and maintainability", "Applying technique A could address the low precision observed").
6. Prioritize hypotheses based on their potential impact and feasibility.

**Output Format:**
Return ONLY a JSON list of strings, where each string is a distinct improvement hypothesis. Do not include any introductory text, explanations, or markdown formatting outside the JSON list.

**Example Output:**
```json
[
  "Hypothesis 1: Description of the first improvement idea.",
  "Hypothesis 2: Description of the second improvement idea.",
  "Hypothesis 3: Description of the third improvement idea."
]
```
